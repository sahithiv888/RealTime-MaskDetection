# MaskNet-Detector: Real-Time Face Mask Detection

## Overview
MaskNet-Detector is a deep learning project that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and OpenCV to detect face masks in real-time. This project aims to contribute to public health and safety by automating the process of mask detection, which is crucial in times of health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Features
- Real-time face mask detection using a custom-built CNN.
- Utilizes Haar Cascade Classifiers for efficient face detection.
- Tested on a dataset comprising images with and without face masks.
- Easy integration with video streams for live mask detection.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found [here](https://data-flair.training/blogs/download-face-mask-data). It consists of 1376 images, divided into two classes: 'with_mask' and 'without_mask'.

## Installation
To use MaskNet-Detector, you will need Python 3.x and the following libraries:
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
